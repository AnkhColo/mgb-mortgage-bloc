MORGAGE BLOC - BANKING DATA ORGANISING APPLICATION

1. This is a web application that provides users with secure access to client banking data using banking apiâ€™s, allowing them to save time in reviewing client eligibility for credit services such as loans, credit cards and mortgages.
2. The time saving aspect is the major selling point. Think about accessing client data with normal methods: balance sheets need to be pulled, the banker needs to analyse the data and the report is collected and sent to the approving manager.
3. All this is bypassed by having a robust, clear and accessible UI that allows one to view the data quite quickly. It also allows them to analyse the data easily with the integrated custom charts and tables. Downloading client data is simple with a download button that permits both CSV(Excel) and PDF formats.
